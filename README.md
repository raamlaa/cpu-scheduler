CPU Scheduler:
This project implements various CPU scheduling algorithms in Python. It simulates the behavior of these algorithms by creating processes and running them through the CPU.

Algorithms:
The following algorithms are currently implemented:
First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF)
Priority Scheduling (PS)
Round Robin (RR)
